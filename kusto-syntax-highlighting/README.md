# Kusto Syntax Definition

A Kusto syntax definition, as a Textmate grammar, packaged for Visual Studio Code. Supports `.csl`, `.kql`, and `.kusto`.

Forked from https://github.com/josin/kusto-syntax-highlighting, original author Josef Sin, modified and re-published compliant with the Apache 2.0 License. Reason for the fork is a significant increase in the number of manually-supported builtin keywords and functions, and a future goal of providing solid support for source-controlled user-defined-functions.

The syntax is originally based on [TextmateBundleInstaller's Kusto syntax](https://github.com/madskristensen/TextmateBundleInstaller/blob/master/src/Bundles/kusto/Syntaxes/kusto.plist).
