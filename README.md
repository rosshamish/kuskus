> The extension pack so nice they named it twice

This repo houses a number of useful extensions supporting Kusto development in VS Code. They _can_ be installed independently, but it's recommended to just install the [extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rosshamish.kuskus-extensions-pack) which includes them all.

Kusto is an ergonomic database query language used extensively across Microsoft: https://aka.ms/kusto.

VS Code is a lightweight code editor https://code.visualstudio.com/
